## C2: curated gene sets
Gene sets in this collection are curated from various sources, including online pathway databases and the biomedical literature. Many sets are also contributed by individual domain experts. The gene set page for each gene set lists its source. The C2 collection is divided into the following two sub-collections: Chemical and genetic perturbations (CGP) and Canonical pathways (CP). details  

## C5: ontology gene sets
Gene sets that contain genes annotated by the same ontology term. The C5 collection is divided into two sub-collections, the first derived from the Gene Ontology resource (GO) which contains BP, CC, and MF components and a second derived from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)

## C7: immunologic signature gene sets
Gene sets that represent cell states and perturbations within the immune system. details

## rna_single_cell_type.tsv

Transcript expression levels summarized per gene in 79 cell types from 30 datasets. The tab-separated file includes Ensembl gene identifier ("Gene"), gene name ("Gene name"), analysed sample ("Cell type") and normalized expresion ("nTPM"). 

## rna_immune_cell_monaco.tsv

Transcript expression levels summarized per gene in 30 immune cell types. The tab-separated file includes Ensembl gene identifier ("Gene"), analysed sample ("Immune cell"), transcripts per million ("TPM") and protein-coding transcripts per million ("pTPM"). The data was obtained from Monaco publication and is based on The Human Protein Atlas version 22.0 and Ensembl version 103.38.
