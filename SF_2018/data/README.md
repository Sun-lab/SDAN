    - CD8T_tpm.tsv.gz: gene expression (TPM) data for 6,350 CD8+ T cells, from 48 samples of 32 patients. 

    - CD8T_cell_info.tsv: information for each of the 6,350 cells. 

    - patient_info.tsv: patient information, obtained from sheet "Patient-scRNA data" of Table S1. 

    - CD8T_gene_info.tsv: gene symbols.


In ```CD8T_cell_info.tsv```, the response label of each cell was assigned based on sample-level response label, which was obtained from sheet "Lesion-scRNAseq data" of Table S1 (```1-s2.0-S0092867418313941-mmc1.xlsx```).
